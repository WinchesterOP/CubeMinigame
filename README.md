## Getting Started

You can download the latest version under [Release](https://github.com/WinchesterOP/CubeMinigame/releases).

The game is in a very early stage and was created to gain some experience with Unity. There are currently only two levels to play.

## Level 1

</p>

<p>
  The left and right movements are performed with the "a" and "d" keys. It must avoid the incoming obstacles as long as you can. The obstacles are randomly generated so this level runs endlessly.
</p>

## Level 2

<p>
  In the second level it is now also possible to move up and down. the length and the obstacles should also be generated automatically, but in the current state of the software it's missing
